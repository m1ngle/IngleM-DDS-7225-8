This project will examine customer usage data for a customer resource management (CRM) company
whose mission is to grow their customers base by insuring their Marketing, Sales, and
Customer success teams are organized to best address their customer needs. The revenue
operations team has the ultimate goal of building an operating system for the Marketing, 
Sales and Customer Success operations. As a business, they are trying
to understand their target audience for one of their core products, our CRM. They would like 
insight into:
1. Of all the prospects that they have, some become customers. What are the biggest
differentiators between prospects that become customers vs prospects that do not
become customers?
2. How can they predict who is likely to convert from a prospect and become a customer?
This company has two tiers of service: a free tier with limited functionality and a paid
tier with expanded functionality. They consider users of hubspotâ€™s free tier to be prospects.
