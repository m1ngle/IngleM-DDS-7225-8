This research project will consider two research questions. First, given the data, what are the greatest differentiators between customers and noncustomers? 
Second, how can the researcher predict which of the noncustomers is most likely to convert to become a customer?
The first two questions will require supervised learning models and the final model will require an unsupervised learning model.
This research paper uses three datasets: customer information, noncustomer information, and actions performed by customers and noncustomers.

This project will be divided into modules which align with the CRISP-DM for increased transparency and replicability.
